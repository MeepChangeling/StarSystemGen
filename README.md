# StarSystemGen
A web app that creates detailed star systems as scientifically accurately as I could manage. Intended to help writers, game masters, and people in need of a desk toy.

Currently WIP, please excuse spelling errors. My IDE dosn't have a spell check. Works fine in browser, can save the text output. Currently working on making it save images. At present it attempts to convert canvas elements to .webp images, generates blank images in the correct folder structure, converts the output from canvas to IMG elements, but... well the images are blank. Not sure why.

If you want to help, that would be amazing. The generated output is fine, but try to use the save function, then open the outputted .html. You'll see all saved versions of the images are blank. Save function starts on 3295. The canvas save thing starts at 3317
